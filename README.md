# the-tale-of-Mr.-Diggins-LD40
It seems like i have have become stranded on a strange planet thatâ€™s only 16 blocks wide and who knows how deep it is and how hard some ores are to mine. Anyways we i need to get off this planet with a rocket or something. But to do that I will have to upgrade my gear and drill and mine some materials. And i need to keep up my fuel levels.
